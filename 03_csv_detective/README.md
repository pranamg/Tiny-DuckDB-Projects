# Chapter 03: CSV Detective

Find clues hidden in CSV data using DuckDB's powerful file reading capabilities.

## Learning Goals

- Read CSV files directly with `read_csv()`
- Filter data with `WHERE` clause
- Use comparison operators
- Combine multiple conditions with `AND`/`OR`

## The Challenge

You're a detective investigating game scores. Given a CSV file of player scores, write queries to:
1. Find all scores above a threshold
2. Find scores from a specific player
3. Find the highest score for each game

## Concepts Introduced

- `read_csv()` function
- `WHERE` clause filtering
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `=`, `!=`)
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` logical operators
- `MAX()`, `MIN()` aggregations
